2023.00002;The court affirms the convictions, finding that they are not against the weight of the evidence.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The court held that the testimony of State Trooper Thomas Tryon, corroborated by the recording from the confidential informant's device, sufficiently established that the defendant knowingly and unlawfully sold methamphetamine to the CI.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The court finds the CI's testimony credible and consistent with corroborative evidence, including the testimony of the CI's wife and state trooper Amanda Giles, as well as forensic testing results.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The court accepts the forensic scientists' testimony regarding their methods and findings, confirming that the substances tested were indeed methamphetamine.;announces;January 5, 2023

2023.00002;Defendant's challenge to the credibility of the forensic scientists' conclusions does not establish a fatal defect, as these issues were fully explored on cross-examination and the jury had an opportunity to evaluate their testimony.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The court finds that substantial corroborating evidence, including recordings and witness testimonies, supports the CI's testimony, making a different verdict unreasonable.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The court held that issues regarding the credibility of forensic scientists were fully explored on cross-examination and the jury had an opportunity to evaluate their testimony.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The court found that a different verdict as to counts 1 and 2 would be unreasonable, given the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.;announces;January 5, 2023

2023.00002;The verdict on count 3 is not against the weight of the evidence, given deference to the jury's credibility determinations and viewing the evidence in a neutral light.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The court properly admitted the recordings as they satisfied several Molineux exceptions, were interwoven with the charged crimes, relevant and material to issues of intent, absence of mistake, and defendant's ability to commit the crimes. The probative value outweighed potential prejudice.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The evidence was admissible as it was inextricably interwoven with the charged crimes and relevant to issues of intent to sell, absence of mistake, and defendant's ability to commit the crime.;announces;January 5, 2023

2023.00002;The ruling may have been an abuse of discretion, but it would be subject to a nonconstitutional harmless error standard. Given the overwhelming evidence of guilt and no significant probability that defendant would have been acquitted due to the error, the court's Sandoval determination was harmless.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The contention lacks merit because although a criminal defendant has the right to confront adverse witnesses through cross-examination, this right is not unlimited.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The court's Sandoval determination was harmless because the evidence of defendant's guilt is overwhelming and there is no significant probability that defendant would have been acquitted but for the error.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;The court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the scope of cross-examination when the questions were irrelevant or only marginally relevant, concern collateral issues, or pose a danger of misleading the jury.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00002;No, the decision was not an abuse of discretion as counsel did not directly impeach the CI on this point during cross-examination.;announces;January 5, 2023

2023.00003;The court held that the defendant's conviction for attempted assault in the first degree was not legally insufficient because the evidence supported an inference of specific intent to cause serious physical injury.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00003;The court held that the defendant's conviction for criminal use of a firearm in the second degree was not against the weight of the evidence because it was based on the same conduct as the attempted assault charge, which demonstrated specific intent.;announces;January 5, 2023

2023.00003;Yes, based on the circumstantial evidence including defendant's call before the shooting, familiarity with the victim's house layout, and the location where the bullet entered the front door, a rational person could conclude that defendant possessed the requisite intent to cause serious physical injury.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00003;Yes, when viewing all credible evidence in a neutral light and deferring to the jury's credibility determinations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that defendant acted with the requisite intent.;announces;January 5, 2023
2023.00003;Yes, given the circumstantial evidence and the jury's credibility determinations, defendant's actions reasonably infer an intent to cause serious physical injury.;announces;January 5, 2023
